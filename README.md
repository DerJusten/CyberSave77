# CyberStart77
Save all of your Quick/Autosaves in Cyberpunk2077 automatically

- Copy new Quick/Autosaves to a different location (can be filtered by age)
- Create customnames (like Level, Gender etc.) based on your savegamefile
- Start any 3rd party applications (e.g. camera tools) when the game is running
- Autosave the game (if possible) if the last save reached a specific age







Disclaimer:
This is just a personal project I wrote for myself, which I wanted to share if anyone have a need for it. The code is pure spaghetti so be aware. Also I am sorry for any grammar errors, since English isn't my mother tongue.
