# CyberStart77

Save all of your Quick/Autosaves in Cyberpunk2077 automatically

- Copy new Quick/Autosaves to a different location (can be filtered by age)
- Create customnames (like Level, Gender etc.) based on your savegamefile
- Start any 3rd party applications (e.g. camera tools) when the game is running
- Autosave the game (if possible) if the last save reached a specific age

## Install
Download the latest CyberStart77_VX.X.zip from the release tab. Unzip the file and execute the CyberStart77.exe, thats it.

## How to use
- set the "Extra savegames path" to any location (NOTE: I don't recommend a subfolder in the original savagame location, since the game will show your copied saves as corrupted)
- (optional) adjust the timers (if you want to use Autosave, do not set the "Savegame interval" too high/ recommend 30-60 seconds)
- (optional) add 3rd party applications, which will be started when the game starts or is already running (NOTE: if the game gets closed, these process will be terminated)
- (optional) adjust options for 'minimum minutes between savefiles', Autosave and CustomNames (top right corner)


 

#### Disclaimer:
This is just a personal project I wrote for myself, which I wanted to share if anyone have a need for it. The code is pure spaghetti and I am trying stuff out.
Also I am sorry for any grammar errors, since English isn't my mother tongue.
