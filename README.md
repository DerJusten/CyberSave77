# CyberStart77

Save all of your Quick/Autosaves in Cyberpunk2077 automatically

- Copy new Quick/Autosaves to a different location (can be filtered by age)
- Create customnames (like Level, Gender etc.) based on your savegamefile
- Start any 3rd party applications (e.g. camera tools) when the game is running
- Autosave the game (if possible) if the last save reached a specific age

## Install
Download the latest CyberStart77_VX.X.zip from the release tab. Unzip the file and execute the CyberStart77.exe, thats it.

## How to use
First of all you should set the path for "Extra savegames path". This is the directory where your Quick/Autosaves get copied to. I recommend not to create an additional directory in the original savegame path (%username%\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077) because else the game thinks your copied saves are corrupted (they are not though). It is no problem to put them in the same directory as the original savegames, but it can get pretty messy (depending on your settings) if you have every 5 minutes a new savegame. I for myself just created a new folder in %username%\CD Projekt Red\ and move the files manually if I need any of them.

The options for minimum minutes between savefiles, Autosave and CustomNames can be found in the additional settings in the top right corner. The rest should be hopefully self explanatory.

 





### Disclaimer:
This is just a personal project I wrote for myself, which I wanted to share if anyone have a need for it. The code is pure spaghetti and I am trying stuff out.
Also I am sorry for any grammar errors, since English isn't my mother tongue.
